- add error handling for mrutils.get_standard_mask if no FSL or FREESURFER
- need to add option to register images to standard spaces (if not)
- add error handling to template.get_template if it doesn't exist!
 I think I can do like this: raise RuntimeError("Meaninging ERRRRRRORR Message!")
- right now returns the html text - need to add option to open up directly in browser
- right now returns (part) of html page (for django insertion) - need option to return entirety
- need to add registration with FSL, output error when software not available
- finish scatter.html, and scatter_atlas.html
- give user option to export svg with all three together
- IMPORTANT: the svg paths are lines - we need curves to fill. It may be better to limit atlases (for vis) to pre-generated (pretty!) svg images from illustrator.  Need to think about this
