UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Installation

     git clone https://github.com/vsoch/pybraincompare
     cd pybraincompare
     sudo python setup.py install

### compare
An example scatterplot image comparison, dynamically rendered using python and d3 from two raw statstical brain maps and an atlas image, [is available](http://vbmis.com/bmi/share/neurovault/scatter_atlas.html)

### annotate
This module will let you convert a triples data structure defining relationships in an ontology to a an interactive d3 visualization, demo is [is available](http://vbmis.com/bmi/share/neurovault/ontology_tree.html). Reverse inference tree also [in development](http://vbmis.com/bmi/share/neurovault/reverse_inference.html).

### network
This module will work with visualization of functional connectivity data, demo is [is available](http://vbmis.com/bmi/share/neurovault/connectogram.html) and see examples folder for how to run with your data.
